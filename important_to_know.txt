Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins)
implementing functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain via separate utilities.
For example, cd, break, continue, and exec cannot be implemented outside of the shell
because they directly manipulate the shell itself.
The history, getopts, kill, or pwd builtins, among others,
could be implemented in separate utilities, but they are more convenient
to use as builtin commands.
